KING COUNTY HOUSES DATA PROJECT.

In this project, we have been assigned the task to analyze the King County House Sales dataset to help a real estate agency understand the factors affecting the selling price of houses. The dataset contains data of houses sold in King County, Washington, USA between May 2014 and May 2015. As data scientists, our goal is to provide accurate and reliable information to homeowners about the potential increase in home value due to different factors. The insights gained from the analysis will help the real estate agency make better decisions and provide valuable advice to homeowners.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING:

The real estate industry is an essential component of the economy, and homeowners rely on the industry to provide them with the right information to make informed decisions. Homeowners are always looking for ways to increase the value of their properties, and understanding the factors that affect the selling price of houses is crucial. By analyzing the King County House Sales dataset, we aim to provide the real estate agency with the necessary insights to help homeowners understand and predict the real estate market.


We shall therefore use the data available to conduct an analysis guided by the business understanding above.

Our main aim for this analysis is to help the real estate agency to have a better understanding of the real estate industry in King county and to help them come up with realistic sales targets and better pricing models.

MODELING:

We used the following regression models:

Simple Linear Regression model - Price vs Sqft_living 
 
Simple Linear Regression model - Price vs Sqft_above

Multiple Linear Regression model - Price vs other variables

REGRESSION RESULTS:

The multiple linear regression model is better than the two simple regression models as it had a higher Rsquared value. This shows that categorical variables had a positive effect on the prices as illustrated in the univariate analysis.

Therefore adding these variables to the predictive model made the model to be a bit stronger.

CONCLUSION:

After analyzing King County data, our final model would suggest the main factors in increasing property value are sqft foot living of the property as well as its grade. Grade refers to the classification based on construction and design structure . This mainly has to do with the types of materials used and the quality of the work done. Buildings that get better grades often cost more to build per unit of measure however we deem that investment profitable as properties that do grade higher, command higher value. Our model does however have its faults. Our final model R^2 was approximately 42% with an MAE of $129,493.34. Linear regression was probably not the best tool to use to get the most out of this data set so in the future we would like to use different more powerful machine learning tools in order to make this a more accurate predictive model
